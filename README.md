# secret_project 1.0
Secret project to battle/track corona virus

# STACK
Maybe we should use AWS stack like:
1. RDS or S3 (depends where we want to store our data - MongoDB (not aws tho) (postgresQL through RDS)
2. EC2 / Lambda / ECS - not sure which one is the best yet
3. Host website - heroku? or can use AWS S3 to host a static website

# TODO:

Business side
1. Define use cases - track people,places at a moment in time? 
2. Find out sample users
3. Find out similar apps
4. Draw up UI and find out things we need.

Dev side
1. Set up Database (PostGreSQL? or MongoDB?) 
2. Host website online
3. Define stack - (Confirmed - Express, Node) (TBD - Typescript/ReactJS/Python??)
4. Front end - ??? Idk i suck at front end tbh can use react
