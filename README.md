Secret project to battle/track corona virus

# STACK
Maybe we should use AWS stack like:
1. RDS or S3 (depends where we want to store our data - MongoDB (not aws tho) (postgresQL through RDS)
2. EC2 / Lambda / ECS - not sure which one is the best yet
3. Host website - heroku? or can use AWS S3 to host a static website

# TODO:
1. Set up Database (PostGreSQL? or MongoDB?) 
2. Host website online
3. Define use cases - track people,places at a moment in time? 
4. Define stack - (Confirmed - Express, Node) (TBD - Typescript/ReactJS/Python??)
5. Front end - ??? Idk i suck at front end tbh can use react
